# Rights management file for Radicale - A simple calendar server
#
# The default path for this kind of files is ~/.config/radicale/rights
# This can be changed in the configuration file::
#
#   [rights]
#   type = from_file
#   file = /etc/radicale/rights
#
# This file gives independant examples to help users write their own
# configuration files.
#
# .. hint::
#
#    1. The first rule matching both user and collection patterns
#       will be returned.
#    2. I needed to setup some 'R' & 'W' to get radicale's internal
#       WEB interface running
#
# About 'R' & 'W' see https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/commit/0a492a ::
#
#   R: read collections without tag
#   r: read collections with tag and included objects
#   W: write and delete collections without tag
#   w: write and delete collection with tag and included objects

# 1. The user "admin" can read and write any collection.
[admin]
user: admin
collection: .*
permissions: RWrw

# 2. Example: dedicated sharing with 3 users
[user001]
user: user001
collection: user002(/.*)?
permissions: r

[user002]
user: user002
collection: user001(/.*)?|user003(/.*)?
permissions: r

[user003]
user: user003
collection: user002(/.*)?
permissions: r

# 3. Authenticated users can read and write their own collections.
[owner-write]
user: .+
collection: %(login)s(/.*)?
permissions: RWrw

# 4. Added 'R' to get WEB interface running
[read]
user: .+
collection: .*
permissions: R
